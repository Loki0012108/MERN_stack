 Learning Goal: Master Full-Stack Web Development using the MERN Stack

 Project Overview

This repository documents my structured 15-day learning journey to understand and implement the MERN Stack for full-stack web development.

The MERN stack is a JavaScript-based technology stack that includes:

* MongoDB – NoSQL database for storing application data
* Express.js– Backend framework for building RESTful APIs
* React.js – Frontend library for building user interfaces
* Node.js– JavaScript runtime environment for server-side development

The goal of this repository is to track daily progress, concepts learned, and practical implementation experience.

---

 Objectives of Learning MERN Stack

* Understand full-stack web development architecture
* Gain proficiency in JavaScript (frontend and backend)
* Build responsive user interfaces using React.js
* Develop RESTful APIs using Express.js
* Handle server-side logic using Node.js
* Perform CRUD operations using MongoDB
* Integrate frontend and backend systems
* Debug effectively using documentation and developer communities
* Deploy a complete MERN stack application

 Role of Stack Overflow in Learning

Stack Overflow plays an important role in the development process by:

* Providing solutions to real-world coding problems
* Helping debug errors efficiently
* Offering best practices and optimization techniques
* Supporting continuous learning through community discussions

It is an essential resource throughout this learning journey.

15-Day Learning Plan & Progress

Day 1 – Introduction to MERN Stack Fundamentals

 Topics Covered

* What is Full-Stack Development?
* Introduction to MERN Architecture
* Overview of:

  * MongoDB
  * Express.js
  * React.js
  * Node.js
* Understanding how frontend, backend, and database interact
* Installation and Setup:

  * Node.js
  * VS Code
  * MongoDB (Local / MongoDB Atlas)
  * Git
* Creating and running a basic Node.js server
* Understanding project structure

 Key Takeaways
